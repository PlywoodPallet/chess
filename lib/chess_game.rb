# User selects chess piece
# Game provides list of legal moves (different based on piece type)
# User choses a legal move
# Game moves piece and removes opposing player's piece if needed

# Legal moves
# Player can only move one's pieces
# Moves that intersect with own pieces are not listed (exception: castling)
# Moves that capture an enemy piece are listed (some extra boundaries based on chess piece, like a rook can't jump over a piece while knight can)

# Legal moves by piece
# King - one square in any direction (+ castling)
# Rook - move along rank or file, cannot jump, (+ castling)
# Bishop - move diagonally, cannot jump
# Queen - Rook + Bishop
# Knight - (+ or -) 1/2 or 2/1, CAN jump
# Pawn - Moves one forward or two forward if first move. Can only capture pieces one diagonally. En passant and promotion

# Game over conditions
# Check - King is under threat, player must only move the king next turn
# Checkmate - King is under threat and has no moves
# Player resign

# Esoteric moves (implement later)
# Castling between King and Rook
# - not a legal response to a check
# En Passant between two pawns
# promotion of a pawn that reaches the eigth rank (row)

# Game over - Draw (implement later)
# Stalemate - player has no legal move and not in check
# Dead position - neither player is able to checkmate. Such as only two kings are on the board (research all possibilities - hope its a short list)
# Draw by agreement - can only be offered after move 30. Implementation not needed
# Threefold repetition - situation too esoteric
# Fifty-move-rule - situation too esoteric

# pieces are denoted by the file its in such as "pawn in f-file"
